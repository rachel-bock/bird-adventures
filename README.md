## Wins
  - Created a dynamic URL for my fetch calls so the Top 100 Contributors is for today.

## Challenges
  - Creating a component to view search results when a user enters a specific bird to search for.
  - Creating a dynamic route to view search results for bird sightings.
  - Learning hooks.
  - Tried implementing global state management using Zustand.

## Improvements
  - Additional CSS styling and background images to make the site more presentable.
  - Adding birds to a checklist of birds to see.
